Hi 🚀

A beginner-level Python project — “Hi”

Hi! I’m Qasim from Pakistan. This repository hosts a small Python script named Hi (or perhaps multiple scripts) that I've built while learning programming. The goal is educational: to practice Python programming basics and share for feedback.

Contents

hi.py (or the main script) — A simple Python program (perhaps prints “Hi”, or performs a small task).

Other Python files (if any) — Make sure to list them here.

.gitignore, and any supporting files or folders.

Features

Very simple and easy to run — good for beginners.

Demonstrates basic Python syntax, input/output, conditionals, loops (if used).

A good playground for learning and modifying.

Requirements

Python 3.8+ (2.x is not supported).

No heavy dependencies unless you added them — if you did, please list them in requirements.txt.

Installation / Running locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Qasimjiho/Hi.git
cd Hi


(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate


(If needed) Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the main script:

python hi.py

Suggestions & Improvements

Add a requirements.txt if there are any external libraries.

Include more descriptive comments and docstrings in the code to explain what each part does.

Provide example inputs and outputs in the README so others can test easily.

If you intend to expand it, consider renaming the project folder to something more descriptive, and structure it with modules/functions.

Add a LICENSE file (for example, MIT License) if you want to allow others to reuse/modify your code.

How you can help / Feedback

If you’d like to improve this project, here are a few ideas:

Refactor the code into one or more functions instead of a flat script.

Add unit tests (using pytest or unittest) to make sure the functionality works as expected.

Add a simple command-line interface (using argparse) so users can pass parameters.

Consider packaging it if it grows (make it a module or CLI tool).

License

This repository currently does not include a license. If you’d like to make it open-source with reuse in mind, you might add an MIT License.
(This is optional — you may also choose another license.)
